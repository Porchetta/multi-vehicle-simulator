[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can

# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where

# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then re-enable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
